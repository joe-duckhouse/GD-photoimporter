# Contributing to Google Drive to Google Photos Importer

Thanks for your interest in improving this Apps Script project! This document outlines how to report issues, propose enhancements, and submit code changes.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
2. Create a branch that describes your work (for example, `feature/add-progress-report`).
3. Make your changes, keeping the code style and structure consistent with the existing script.
4. Update documentation and tests (if applicable) to reflect your changes.
5. Run any relevant checks locally before opening a pull request.

## Filing issues

* Search existing issues before opening a new one to avoid duplicates.
* Include steps to reproduce bugs, expected vs. actual behavior, and any relevant error output.
* For feature requests, describe the user problem and why the enhancement is valuable.

## Pull request checklist

Before submitting a PR:

- [ ] Ensure your branch is rebased on the latest `main`.
- [ ] Include focused commits with clear messages describing the change.
- [ ] Update the README or other docs when behavior changes.
- [ ] Verify that linting and tests (if any) pass.
- [ ] Reference related issues in the PR description (e.g., "Closes #123").

## Code review process

1. Open a pull request that clearly states the problem and solution.
2. A maintainer will review your changes, leaving feedback or approval.
3. Address review comments by pushing follow-up commits (avoid force-pushing unless requested).
4. Once approved, the PR will be merged. Thank you for contributing!
